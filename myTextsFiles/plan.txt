User Management System

The app will have a user and super user/administrator.
The user will be able to register/add and account.
The administrator will have the control over the app; that is, he or she will be able to 
update the status and delete the user. All users will be displayed on browser.

Handlebars will be used to build templetes that do server-side rendering

If time allows, I would like to let users post images and chat with friends
